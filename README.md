## Abstract  
This paper presents a framework for using real-time big-data to inform a transport Agent Based
Model (ABM) for a range of scenario testing applications. Computational advances have enabled
for increasingly complex, bottom-up, fine resolution simulations to be carried out over long time
horizons at fine spatial and temporal resolution. This has hinted at the possibility of connecting
scales of what has been historically been fine resolution operational models and coarse resolution
strategic models. The value of any fine resolution dynamic model is limited by the quality of its
inputs. The wave of new geospatially connected devices has enabled the harvesting of fine
resolution spatial and temporal data on travellers’ and even the infrastructure itself. This crowd-
sourced data can be used to inform dynamic models with real-world and real-time data,
bypassing the need for generalised functions and/or expensive survey data. In this paper, Google
Directions API data and Transport for London data feeds are presented in a framework for
London. The use of decentralised data structures is also presented and comment is made on the
possibilities of using parallel computing advances in Computer Science to scaling up fine
resolution scenario testing transportation models and enabling support for a range of agent
decision making methodologies. Such data structures offer performance improvements in the
storing of dynamic data that may be manipulated in order to simulate local and global hard
infrastructure scenarios alone or in tandem with traditional policy or dynamic policy making
scenarios.
